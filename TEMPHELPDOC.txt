impl chess back and forward buttons:

let ReversedList be a container type that pushes and pops from the "front" such that the front is index 0

let boards: ReversedList[Board] = ReversedList()

draw_idx = 0
on draw calls, draw the board at boards[draw_idx]
0 is the present, 1 is 1 turn in the past, and so on

every new turn, we pop draw_idx items from the front via a for loop and then push the new board to the front of the ReversedList

if we "forward," we just try to decrement draw_idx, not letting it go below 0.
if we "backward," we increment, not letting it go above boards.len() or w/e

ALTERNATIVELY LITERALLY JUST USE A NORMAL LIST AND NEGATIVELY INDEX :p
