This folder contains screenshots and the compiled animation from a game I played with a friend. Yes, there is another queen that is actually a pawn. There may be additional errors.

This game was played with the ruleset:
- alternating player turns, starting with white
- on each turn, the player must move a piece and may rotate a piece, in that order
- pawns, knights, and kings may jump
- pawns always have access to their two-forward movement
