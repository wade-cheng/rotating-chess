This folder contains screenshots and the compiled animation from a game I played with a friend. We kept accidentally deleting or capturing pieces, so there is a wayward pawn pretending to be a queen during the earlygame and a king pretending to be a king in late. There may be additional errors.

This game was played with the ruleset:
- alternating player turns, starting with white
- on each turn, the player must move a piece and may rotate a piece, in that order
- pawns, knights, and kings may jump
- pawns always have access to their two-forward movement

Pawns felt weirdly balanced. Bishops are often trapped, and the "rotate rook pawn and move it forward the next move to open the rook file" opening was very interesting. Tempo was very strong with the "rotate a piece to check, then move other piece" strategy when cover was sparse. All in all, _incredibly_ entertaining.
